# NetNeutraal

Hi there! Me and a friend are designing a website for a school project: We're researching what people (in The Netherlands) know about Net Neutrality (In Dutch Netneutraliteit). We are strongly for netneutrality. We expect that others (aka non digital people) are not sure what netneutrality means. With this project we want to learn what people know and teach them a bit more about it.

After the user summits the form it will get send in form of POST data to a Google Script, the script will parse the data to a spreadsheet. You could also use PHP to parse the data to a SQL database.

We <3 opensource, the whole website is available here on Github, use it however you want, learn something about it. If you wish you could make this to a website of your own (Please open an issue, we would love to know about it!). Note, this whole project (Except W3CSS and FullPage.JS) are under a [CC-BY-NC](https://github.com/J0113/netneutraal/blob/master/LICENSE.md) license, so use it freely but nothing comercial and give us some decent credits.
